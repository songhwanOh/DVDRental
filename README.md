# Sakila DVD Rental Database Analysis


## Project Details

Course: Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python

Project Context: This project is part of the curriculum for the Programming for Data Science with Python course offered by Udacity. The objective is to utilize SQL querying techniques on the Sakila DVD Rental database to derive insights into customer behavior, movie preferences, payment earnings, and store performance.

## Introduction

This project involves querying the Sakila DVD Rental database, which contains extensive information about a company specializing in renting movie DVDs. The aim is to extract insights and gain a comprehensive understanding of various aspects related to the customer base, movie-watching patterns across different customer groups, payment earnings comparison, and performance evaluation of different stores.

## Tools Used

- PostgreSQL for querying the Sakila DVD Rental database.
- Visualization tools for presenting query outputs visually.

## Project Objectives

- Understand movie-watching patterns across various customer groups.
- Analyze and compare payment earnings among different customer segments.
- Evaluate and compare the performance of different stores within the company.

## Queries and Analysis

The following SQL queries were used to extract insights from the database:
- Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out. Show only the movies that were rented out more than 30 times.
- Provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the average rental duration(in the number of days) for movies across all categories.
- Provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category
- Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month.

## Visualizations
Visualizations were created to illustrate key findings and insights obtained from the queries.
